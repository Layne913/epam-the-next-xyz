    "summary": "Europe and Asia meet in Istanbul, and throughout this vibrant city, you’ll find centuries-old mosques, churches and markets happily co-existing with modern restaurants, galleries and nightclubs. And plan on visiting a hamman (traditional Turkish bath)—for about $20 your skin will be scrubbed clean. And we mean scrubbed. Your wimpy loofah has nothing on this.",

    "title": "Cappadocia",
    "summary": "Lying in south central Turkey, the moonscaped region of Cappadocia, southeast of Ankara, is most famous for unique geological features called fairy chimneys. The large, cone-like formations were created over time by erosion of the relatively soft volcanic ash around them. Past cultures have dug into them to create dwellings, castles (like Uchisar) and even entire underground cities like Kaymakli and Derinkuyu, used as hiding places by early Christians. Nearby Kayseri is the gateway to the area.",

    "summary": "Pristine white cliffs tower over this recently revitalized spa town with its Sacred Pool and calcium-rich mineral springs. The pool is set amid a gorgeous garden, and a teahouse is adjacent. Pamukkale is most pleasant once the crowds of summer have departed, but temperatures have not yet plummeted.",
